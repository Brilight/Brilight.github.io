# 👨🏻‍💻 Biography

I am a second-year PhD student in the <a href='http://www.aais.pku.edu.cn'>Academy for Advanced Interdisciplinary Studies </a> and <a href='https://ic.pku.edu.cn'>School of Integrated Cirtuits </a>, Peking University. 

My research interest includes AI for EDA, physical simulation, including lithography, electromagnetic, and thermal simulation. I also pay close attention to excellent machine learning technology. I am a recipient of the Best Paper Awards Nomination at ICCAD-22.
